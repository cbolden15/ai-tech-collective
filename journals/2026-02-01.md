## 📚 Term of the Day: Industry Fluency

**Term:** `Agentic AI`

- **Plain English:** AI that can autonomously take actions and make decisions to achieve a goal, rather than just providing information or suggestions. It acts on your behalf.
- **Why it matters:** It's the next evolution beyond chatbots, moving towards AI assistants that can complete entire tasks, like making purchases, booking appointments, or managing complex workflows, without constant human oversight. This is a major trend for 2026, especially in e-commerce and enterprise automation.
- **Business example:** An AI shopping agent that not only recommends products but also processes the entire checkout on behalf of the user, or a virtual assistant that manages your calendar and sends meeting invites without explicit step-by-step instructions.
- **Sound fluent:** "The shift to **agentic AI** is redefining customer interactions, allowing systems to not just advise, but to *act* on behalf of the user."
