## 📚 Term of the Day: Industry Fluency

**Term:** `Agentic AI`

-   **Plain English:** An AI system that can autonomously plan, execute, and monitor multi-step tasks to achieve a goal, often interacting with other tools and environments, rather than just responding to single prompts.
-   **Why it matters:** It shifts AI from being a "copilot" (assistant) to an "owner" (delegated worker) of workflows, enabling higher levels of automation and efficiency for complex business processes.
-   **Business example:** Claude Cowork automating file organization and document creation on a user's computer, or an AI system that manages an entire sales follow-up sequence from lead qualification to personalized email outreach.
-   **Sound fluent:** "The real game-changer isn't just generative AI, it's **agentic AI** taking over entire workflows, like automated client onboarding."
